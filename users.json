We then develop a feature-based matrix factorization approach which can leverage the learnt user embeddings for cold-start product recommendation.

(Paddy, Sugarcane) Preparation of GT points where ground information is to be collected using clustering algorithms on the SAR images. For AP data, we fitted cubic polynomial on the SAR time series data. The fitted coefficients were used to predict the crop type on unseen SAR data. (Paddy, Sugarcane and Others) Key Learning: - Python, machine learning models Chest X-ray disease diagnosis using machine learning We make model which diagnose the disease using convolution neural network from the chest X-Ray. We had a dataset which has fifteen type of disease. Secondly, clinical diagnosis of X-ray images often require teams of trained radiologists to accurately estimate the type of disease which often consumes time and is expensive. Key Learning: - Python, machine learning, CNN Fingerprint based voting machine We make voting machine using fingerprint sensor. We create a database using SQL. Finally we display the winning candidate. Key Learning: - SQL, Fingerprint sensor"

Role: Software Engineer. While working in EAI team I got to work in innovation projects and I have successfully completed them by learning new technologies like Angular JS, ASP.NET MVC, C# Web APIs and I have worked on both the application alone from scratch till implementation. Table Management Application: I have developed a web client Application using Angular JS, HTML and CSS to update the look up tables by calling Rest APIs and Created C# LDAP web Application for authentication and C# proxy service to remove CORS issue as our web services are not handling CORS. Message Archive: I have completed the message archive process to improve the process of searching patients/records in PROD message archive environments as It's quite slow while fetching records and we have storage till 30 days only so we have developed Message Archive project to mitigate these problems, I have written cache object script code to convert HL7 message to JSON format and posting these JSON objects in Cosmos DB BLOB to Storage Account/Blob services in azure and we have a .Net UI for searching the patients using this web client application. In planning phase, we will resend the patient to Ensemble back once you got the correct one so in this way we are mitigating the problems of Slow RDBMS database response and we have increased storage patient records for more than 30 days. In this project I got working experience on C# web API's, Azure cosmos DB, blob storage, search service and function Apps. While working on message archive project I went through several Document DBs like Mongo Db, elastic search and Cosmos Db Responsibilities: Involved in the requirement study, design and enhancement of the product. Learned new technologies. Worked as Individual contributor Maintenance, production support. Client interaction and attending project related meetings. Debugging and Bug Fixes.
